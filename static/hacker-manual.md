## <i class='icon map'></i> Travel and Accommodation

### Travelling to Brno

The best way to go to Brno from Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Bratislava or other bigger cities is by train. You can choose from more carriers and price levels, but all trains are safe, usualy equipped with wifi and plugs, usualy serving some snacks and coffee. You can find your connectin on [this link](https://idos.idnes.cz/en/vlakyautobusymhdvse/spojeni/). For example [here](https://idos.idnes.cz/en/vlakyautobusymhdvse/spojeni/vysledky/?date=04.11.2022&time=06:00&f=V%C3%ADde%C5%88%20leti%C5%A1t%C4%9B;%20Austria&fc=100003&t=Brno%20hl.n.&tc=100003) are some train connections from Vienna airport to Brno main station on Friday 4th.

We recommend you to use private carrier [RegioJet](https://regiojet.com/) which provides bus connection as well.

### Brno Public transport

It is safe to use public transport in Brno even in the night. Public transport in Brno and the rest of the South Moravian Region is provided by JMK (the South Moravian Integrated Public Transport System). Tickets are valid for any form of public transport, so you only need to pay attention to how long you are traveling (tickets are valid for specific amounts of time) and which zones you are travelling through. If you’re travelling through the city, a ticket for zones 100 and 101 is probably all you’ll need. You can buy tickets from any of the yellow ticket vending machines located at various stops throughout the city, or you can purchase them at information centres, stations, and newsagents. If you have a Czech phone number, you can buy tickets by sending a text message or using a mobile app. You can also pay contactless in the vehicles.

### Accomodation
We do not provide or subsidize accomodation. Main venue is 24/7 though, so feel free to enjoy the hackathon in its purest form. If you don't feel like it, we do have following recommended facilities:

#### Budget - Most Unique Hostel in Brno – 10-Z Bunker Hostel.

## Hackathon 

### <i class='icon book'></i>  Mentoring

Our amazing mentors are here to discuss anything related to your project. Not just code, but also ideas, concepts, design and presentation. They will generally be hanging around a **Mentor Base**, where you can come find them in person. You can also reach them on Matrix, in the **Mentor-help** chat. It’s always better to ask for advice sooner rather than later, you will learn and build quicker that way.

### <i class='icon users'></i> Finding a Team / Project Idea

If you’re missing team-mates or ideas for projects we’ve got you covered. You can start by writing into the **Find-a-team** chat on our [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethbrno:gwei.cz). Introduce yourself, discuss ideas, see what others are up to… There will also be a **Team-building session**, which will take place after the opening ceremony of Friday night. No need to prepare anything, just turn up. This session will be followed by a short **Brainstorm**, that you can also attend. We will take you and your team through a couple of exercises, which should lead you to at least one solid project idea. Then you’ll have everything to start your weekend of hacking!

### <i class='icon coffee'></i> Catering
We will take care of your meals and drinks for the entire Hackathon, conference and coffee breaks. There will be vegan options provided. Just come with an open mind, a knowledge-thirsty brain and enthusiasm.
