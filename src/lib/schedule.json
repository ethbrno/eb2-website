Is this still valid?\r\n\r\nThe blind signing issue resonated heavily on the OG Council discussion during ETH Amsterdam 2022. Almost half of the attendees\r\nrelied on a Trezor T device, a similar amount on a Ledger device. All these attendees claimed to suffer from the blind-signing issue.\r\nSeveral examples of stolen assets are already due to the planted function parameters and hacked Metamask when interacting with contracts. Millions of USD.\r\n\r\nYet, these HW wallets do not show the contract's call with parameters and values. Instead, they show some data gibberish.\r\n\r\nCan we improve that? And bring the signing confidence back to users?",

                "description": "Email, SMS, and messengers such as WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and others are known and used by almost everyone today. The lack of comprehensive end-to-end encryption (e.g., for e-mail) and closed silos for central messenger services are currently common. Cross-application communication is not possible. User profiles are under the control of large corporations.\r\nWith the web3, we have new possibilities like key-based identities, decentralized register on the blockchain, and end-to-end encryption, ...\r\nWith dm3, there exists a lean protocol for peer-2-peer messaging, which makes it possible to easily integrate secure communication into DApps. The user always has full control over his contacts and information. Intermediaries controlling the communication are not needed.",

In 2019 he designed a cipher that entered the NIST Lightweight Encryption Standard competition. Consequently, he proved himself in designing and implementing blockchains from scratch as the co-founder of QANPlatform and as an early partner of CasperLabs. Having built dozens of dApps, protocols and full chains from both mass-market and government clients, Silur is also a co-organizer of the largest Capture the flag event on the planet, in which he challenges the best hackers in the world to break blockchain systems and reproduce historical cryptocurrency hacks. Silur is also a member of the Wigner's research centre of physics where he specializes on quantum computation and post-quantum cryptography.",
