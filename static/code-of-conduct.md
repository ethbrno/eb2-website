We are a collective and we want to bring people in the community together to exchange ideas, make new friends, and build things as an inclusive, welcoming, and safe community.

Therefore, any harmful or discriminating behavior by anyone (volunteers, organizers, project leads, contributors, hackers, or absolutely anyone involved in our community) will not be tolerated and results in the offending person(s) being excluded from the group.

Members should be judged by their actions, not criteria such as degrees, age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), or position. We are a diverse community. Leave your egos at the door.

## Be Open
We welcome one and all. We especially love to adopt newbies in the community. We foster decentralized, open communities, society, and technology, so we should be open to everyone and everything. We all bring different backgrounds and experiences. Great things can happen when we show up with an open mind and curiosities to explore. If you don't have an open mind, this group is not for you.

## Be Respectful
Be exceptionally kind to others. Respect their work, time, and perspectives. Do not insult or troll others, unless it is for banter (covered in a later point). We all spend our time, resources, and energy to be part of this group. Respect each other, the projects, and the process.

## Be Daring
Dare to create something nobody did before. If you get stuck, ask for help - people will help you when you ask. This is a community. We create things together.

## What We Create
Promote Decentralization. Build what matters to you. You can organize events, build applications, or foster public discourse. You can create art and beauty on a computer. Most importantly, create, hack, and build together.

## Contributions in Other Ways
Banter and memeing is encouraged as you see fit.

## Personal Responsibility
Everyone in this community is responsible for their own tasks. If you have a project, it is your responsibility to manage it. We are not here to spoon feed you or do your work for you. Ain't nobody got time for that. But we are a community and here to support. Always reach out if you are having issues with completing a task.

## Unacceptable Behavior & Harassment
Unacceptable behavior includes: intimidation, harassment, abuse, discrimination, derogatory or demeaning words or actions by any participant in our community online or in person. If you have disagreements with someone, communicate directly with each other and work on a solution.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.

## Notify Us
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, you can always notify a project lead, event organizer, or member of the core group. Anytime. We will do everything to help and support you. If you can't find anyone in person, reach out via email: [utxo@utxo.foundation](mailto:utxo@utxo.foundation)
